# ---DONE---
# The bot should recognize game guesser results posted to the chat and give them a score
# based on the image of red/green blocks
# The score should be assigned to the user who posted the link
# The bot should only take one score input per user per day
# THIS CAN BE CONTROLLED WITH THE TIME ZONE ROLES
# The bot should keep track of each users lifetime and weekly scores
# The bot should post on Saturday night the high scorers of the week

# ---WIP---
# The bot should operate on a raspberry pi
# The bot should backup the game data once a week

# The bot should respond to requests for score info from users
# Generate fun message for high score or hot streaks
# Track medals, assign prestige

# User scores have the 1. username, 2. lifetime points, 3. weekly points, 4. score flag
# Maybe add hot streak flag or medal tracking later
